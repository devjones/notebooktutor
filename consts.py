clipper_input = """Europa Clipper (previously known as Europa Multiple Flyby Mission) is a space probe developed by NASA to study Europa, a Galilean moon of Jupiter. It was launched on October 14, 2024, and is expected to arrive in the Jupiter system in 2030. The spacecraft will then perform a series of flybys of Europa while in orbit around Jupiter.[14][15] The spacecraft is larger than any other used for previous NASA planetary missions.[16]

Europa Clipper will perform follow-up studies to those made by the Galileo spacecraft during its eight years (1995â€“2003) in Jupiter orbit, which indicated the existence of a subsurface ocean underneath Europa's ice crust. Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were initially conceived with projects such as Europa Orbiter and Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, in which a spacecraft would be injected into orbit around Europa. However, due to the adverse effects of radiation from the magnetosphere of Jupiter in Europa orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter and make 44 close flybys of the moon instead. The mission began as a joint investigation between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and was built with a scientific payload of nine instruments contributed by JPL, APL, Southwest Research Institute, University of Texas at Austin, Arizona State University and University of Colorado Boulder. Europa Clipper complements European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, launched in 2023, which will attempt to fly past Europa twice and Callisto multiple times before moving into orbit around Ganymede.

Europa Clipper was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A on October 14, 2024, aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket[17] in a fully expended configuration. The spacecraft will use gravity assists from Mars on March 1, 2025,[18] and Earth on December 3, 2026,[19] before arriving at Europa in April 2030.[20] """
